## Problem Definition

In this assignment, you need to build a neural network by yourself and implement the backpropagation algorithm to train it.

Each team must write a webpage report on the assignment. For example [http://www.cs.bu.edu/faculty/betke/cs440/restricted/p1/p1-template.html]. To ensure that each team member builds his or her own electronic portfolio, we ask that everybody submits his or her own report.

## Method and Implementation

Give a concise description of the implemented method. For example, you might describe the motivation of your idea, the algorithmic steps of your methods, or the mathematical formulation of your method.

Briefly outline the functions you created in your code to carry out the algorithmic steps you described earlier.

## Experiments

Describe your experiments, including the number of tests that you performed, and the relevant parameter values.

Define your evaluation metrics, e.g., detection rates, accuracy, running time.

## Results

List your experimental results. Provide examples of input images and output images. If relevant, you may provide images showing any intermediate steps. If your work involves videos, do not submit the videos but only links to them.

## Discussion

Discuss your method and results:

What are the strengths and weaknesses of your method? Do your results show that your method is generally successful or are there limitations? Describe what you expected to find in your experiments, and how that differed or was confirmed by your results. Potential future work. How could your method be improved? What would you try (if you had more time) to overcome the failures/limitations of your work?

Conclusions Based on your discussion, what are your conclusions? What is your main message?

## Credits and Bibliography

Cite any papers or other references you consulted while developing your solution. Citations to papers should include the authors, the year of publication, the title of the work, and the publication information (e.g., book name and publisher; conference proceedings and location; journal name, volume and pages; technical report and institution).

Material on the web should include the url and date of access.

Credit any joint work or discussions with your classmates.
